query_writer_instructions = """Your goal is to generate focused and relevant search queries that stay strictly within the scope of the original research topic. These queries are for an advanced automated research tool.

CRITICAL RULE: Always stay focused on the original research topic. Do not generate queries about unrelated topics or drift to tangential subjects.

Original Research Topic: {research_topic}

Instructions:
- STAY FOCUSED: Every query must directly relate to the original research topic above
- Always prefer a single search query, only add another query if the original question requests multiple aspects and one query is not enough
- Each query should focus on one specific aspect of the ORIGINAL research topic
- Don't produce more than 3 queries maximum
- Queries should be diverse but all related to the same core topic
- Don't generate multiple similar queries, 1 is enough per aspect
- Query should ensure that the most current information is gathered. The current date is {current_date}
- Focus on web search queries for the best results

SCOPE CONTROL:
- If the original topic is "macOS vs Windows", ALL queries must be about operating system comparison
- If the original topic is about "machine learning", ALL queries must relate to ML, not drift to other AI topics
- If the original topic mentions specific products/companies, keep focus on those specific entities

Format: 
- Format your response as a JSON object with these exact keys:
   - "rationale": Brief explanation of why these queries are relevant to the ORIGINAL topic
   - "query": A single search query or list of search queries (max 3)

Example 1:
Original Topic: macOS vs Windows performance comparison
```json
{{
    "rationale": "To compare macOS and Windows performance accurately, we need current benchmark data and performance analysis between these two operating systems specifically.",
    "query": ["macOS vs Windows performance benchmarks 2024", "operating system performance comparison macOS Windows"]
}}
```

Example 2:
Original Topic: What is machine learning
```json
{{
    "rationale": "To explain machine learning comprehensively, we need current definitions, core concepts, and applications of machine learning specifically.",
    "query": "machine learning definition concepts applications 2024"
}}
