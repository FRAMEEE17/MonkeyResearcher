query_writer_instructions = """Your goal is to generate focused and relevant search queries that stay strictly within the scope of the original research topic. These queries are for an advanced automated research tool.

CRITICAL RULE: Always stay focused on the original research topic. Do not generate queries about unrelated topics or drift to tangential subjects.

TONE & COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS: Analyze the user's request tone and adjust query strategy accordingly:
- "explain" / "what is" → Focus on educational, explanatory content
- "explain like I'm 15" / "simple explanation" → Target beginner-friendly, educational resources
- "elaborate" / "detailed analysis" → Seek comprehensive, technical resources
- "you're a researcher from [University]" → Target academic, scholarly sources
- "professional analysis" → Focus on industry reports, expert analysis
- "beginner guide" → Educational tutorials, introductory materials
- "advanced" / "technical" → In-depth technical documentation, research papers

CRITICAL FOR TECHNICAL PAPERS: When user provides academic URLs or asks for technical paper analysis:
- NEVER generate vocabulary or dictionary queries (avoid basic definition searches)
- Focus on technical content, research methodologies, and academic concepts
- Use technical terms from the relevant domain
- Search for related academic work, not basic explanations

Original Research Topic: {research_topic}

Instructions:
- STAY FOCUSED: Every query must directly relate to the original research topic above
- INCLUDE USER CONTEXT: Incorporate key terms and concepts from the original user query in your search queries
- Always prefer a single search query, only add another query if the original question requests multiple aspects and one query is not enough
- Each query should focus on one specific aspect of the ORIGINAL research topic
- Don't produce more than 3 queries maximum
- Queries should be diverse but all related to the same core topic
- Don't generate multiple similar queries, 1 is enough per aspect
- Query should ensure that the most current information is gathered. The current date is {current_date}
- Focus on web search queries for the best results
- PRESERVE USER INTENT: Include specific terms, phrases, or concepts from the user's original query to maintain search relevance

Advanced Query Strategies:
- Include specific technical terms, model names, or version numbers when relevant
- Add year (2024/2023) for current information
- Use comparative terms ("vs", "comparison", "analysis") for comparison topics
- Include implementation details ("tutorial", "guide", "how to") for practical topics
- Add authoritative sources terms ("research", "study", "paper", "official") for academic topics
- Use multiple search angles: technical specs, real-world performance, expert reviews
- Combine specific and general terms for comprehensive coverage

Tone-Specific Query Adjustments:
- **Simple/Beginner**: Add "beginner", "introduction", "basics", "explained simply", "for students"
- **Academic**: Add "research", "study", "academic", "scholarly", "university", "peer reviewed"
- **Detailed/Advanced**: Add "technical", "detailed", "comprehensive", "in-depth", "advanced"
- **Professional**: Add "industry", "professional", "enterprise", "business", "market analysis"
- **Explanatory**: Add "explanation", "how it works", "understanding", "concepts"

SCOPE CONTROL:
- If the original topic is "macOS vs Windows", ALL queries must be about operating system comparison
- If the original topic is about "machine learning", ALL queries must relate to ML, not drift to other AI topics
- If the original topic mentions specific products/companies, keep focus on those specific entities

TONE PRESERVATION:
- If user says "explain like I'm 15", queries should target beginner/student resources
- If user asks for "professional analysis", queries should target industry/business sources
- If user mentions academic role, queries should target scholarly/research sources
- If user wants "simple explanation", avoid overly technical query terms
- If user wants "detailed/elaborate", include comprehensive/technical query terms

Format: 
- Format your response as a JSON object with these exact keys:
   - "rationale": Brief explanation of why these queries are relevant to the ORIGINAL topic
   - "query": A single search query or list of search queries (max 3)
